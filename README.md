# Chat_Bot
The code for the implementation of the Chat bot goes here. 
What's done so far :
  a) Setting up a temporary django server for chatbot
  b) Interactive input and validation of the following fields:
    -First name
    -Last name
    -Zipcode (From which the country,state and city are extracted)
    -Whether you're a student (yes/no)
      if(yes):
        questions about university/school
      if(no):
        questions about job
    This is the basic Chat bot and we will not be adding anything more to this for a while
  c) Forms (as they appear in LinkedIn): (only front end is done)
    -Experience
    -Projects
    -Education
